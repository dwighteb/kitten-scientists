# Minified Builds

For each of these releases on GitHub, you will usually find 2 important files:

1. A file that ends in `.min.user.js`
1. A file that ends in `.user.js`

Usually, you want to use the `.user.js` version, unless you are very concerned about bandwidth usage. The `.min.user.js` variant is functionally identical to the _full_ version, it has just been additionally run through a process to make the JS output as small as possible.
