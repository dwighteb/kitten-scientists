# Kitten Science

## Kitten Scientists

KS is a userscript for [Kittens Game](https://kittensgame.com/web/), which allows you to automate most tasks in the game.

You load the script into your game through a [userscript manager or a bookmarklet](./installation/quick-start.md) and it will create a new panel in your UI with options to configure the behavior of KS.

!!! note

    For the documentation of the current _development_ version of KS, head over to <https://next.kitten-science.com>.

KS was originally developed by [Cameron Condry](https://github.com/cameroncondry) and has since been extended by many great contributors. The v2 of KS is a major effort to rewrite the entire script with more modern approaches, fix all issues in the script, and add new features.
